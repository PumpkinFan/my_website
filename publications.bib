abstract  ="Aqueous Zn/MnO2 batteries with their environmental sustainability and competitive cost{,} are becoming a promising{,} safe alternative for grid-scale electrochemical energy storage. Presented as a promising design principle to deliver a higher theoretical capacity{,} this work offers fundamental understanding of the dissolution–deposition mechanism of Zn/β-MnO2. A multimodal synchrotron characterization approach including three operando X-ray techniques (powder diffraction{,} absorption spectroscopy{,} and fluorescence microscopy) is coupled with elementally resolved synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography. Together they provide a direct correlation between structural evolution{,} reaction chemistry{,} and 3D morphological changes. Operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy show a crystalline-to-amorphous phase transition. Quantitative modeling of the operando data by Rietveld refinement for X-ray diffraction and multivariate curve resolution (MCR) for X-ray absorption spectroscopy are used in a complementary fashion to track the structural and chemical transitions of both the long-range (crystalline phases) and short-range (including amorphous phases) ordering upon cycling. Scanning X-ray microscopy and full-field nano-tomography visualizes the morphology of electrodes at different electrochemical states with elemental sensitivity to spatially resolve the formation of the Zn- and Mn-containing phases. Overall{,} this work critically indicates that for Zn/MnO2 aqueous batteries{,} the reaction pathways involving Zn–Mn complex formation upon cycling become independent of the polymorphs of the initial electrode and sheds light on the interplay among structural{,} chemical{,} and morphological evolution for electrochemically driven phase transitions.",

abstract = {Thin-film solid-state metal dealloying (thin-film SSMD) is an emerging technique that uses self-organization to design nanostructured thin films. The resulting 3D bicontinuous nanostructures are promising for a wide range of applications, such as catalysis and energy storage. In this work, we prepared thin films by SSMD using Ti-Cu as the parent alloy and Mg as the solvent. Using a multimodal approach, we combined synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy, diffraction, and high-resolution electron-based spectroscopy and imaging to study their morphological, structural, and chemical evolution. The processing-structure relationship was analyzed as a function of parent alloy composition and dealloying temperature and time. Morphological transitions from globular, to lamellar, to bicontinuous structures, in conjunction with a ligament size evolution, were identified as functions of the parent alloy composition. The dealloying rate increased with increasing concentration of interdiffusing elements (dissolving component) in the parent alloy. The parting limit, a dealloying compositional threshold, was systematically analyzed and determined to be 30%–40%. The order of crystalline phase formation is CuMg2, Cu2Mg, and Ti; the Ti phase first shows self-reorganization during dealloying, separate from the crystallization process. The coarsening in thin-film SSMD was identified and not entirely self-similar; in addition to the increase of ligament size over time, the formation of larger globular ligaments were also observed. This work furthers our fundamental understanding of thin-film SSMD and nanostructured thin-film design, where the thermodynamic and kinetic effects differ from the bulk counterparts. The fact that dealloying and diffusion outpaces the crystallization and new phase formation also offers opportunities to utilize thin-film SSMD in certain alloy systems in which deleterious intermetallic phases need to be suppressed, that may not be possible in the bulk geometry.},

abstract={Porous materials with high specific surface area, high porosity, and high electrical conductivity are promising materials for functional applications, including catalysis, sensing, and energy storage. Molten salt dealloying was recently demonstrated in microwires as an alternative method to fabricate porous structures. The method takes advantage of the selective dissolution process introduced by impurities often observed in molten salt corrosion. This work further investigates molten salt dealloying in bulk Ni--20Cr alloy in both KCl--MgCl2 and KCl--NaCl salts at 700 {\textcelcius}, using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography. Micro-sized pores with irregular shapes and sizes ranging from sub-micron to several microns and ligaments formed during the process, while the molten salt dealloying was found to progress several microns into the bulk materials within 1--16 h, a relatively short reaction time, enhancing the practicality of using the method for synthesis. The ligament size increased from{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}0.7 $\mu$m to{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}1.3 $\mu$m in KCl--MgCl2 from 1 to 16 h due to coarsening, while remaining{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}0.4 $\mu$m in KCl--NaCl during 16 h of exposure. The XRD analysis shows that the corrosion occurred primarily near the surface of the bulk sample, and Cr2O3 was identified as a corrosion product when the reaction was conducted in an air environment (controlled amount sealed in capillaries); thus surface oxides are likely to slow the morphological coarsening rate by hindering the surface diffusion in the dealloyed structure. 3D-connected pores and grain boundary corrosion were visualized by synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography. This study provides insights into the morphological and chemical evolution of molten salt dealloying in bulk materials, with a connection to molten salt corrosion concerns in the design of next-generation nuclear and solar energy power plants.},

abstract = {Abstract Solid-state metal dealloying (SSMD) is a promising method for fabricating nanoscale metallic composites and nanoporous metals across a range of materials. Thin-film SSMD is particularly attractive due to its ability to create fine features via solid-state interfacial reactions within a thin-film geometry, which can be integrated into devices for various applications. This work examines a new dealloying couple, namely the Nb–Al alloy with the dealloying agent Sc, as previously predicted in the machine-learning (ML) models. Prior ML predictions aimed to guide the design of nanoarchitectured materials through dealloying, relying on intuition-driven discovery within a large parameter space. However, this work reveals that at the nanoscale, the involvement of oxygen in thin film processing may instead drive the dealloying process, resulting in the formation of bicontinuous nanostructures similar to those formed by metal-agent dealloying. The phase evolution, as well as chemical and morphological changes, are closely analyzed using a combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy, diffraction, and scanning transmission electron microscopy to understand the mechanisms behind nanostructure formation. The findings suggest a potential pathway for utilizing oxygen to drive the formation of bicontinuous metal–metal oxide nanocomposites, paving the way for further development of functional nanoporous materials in diverse fields.},
